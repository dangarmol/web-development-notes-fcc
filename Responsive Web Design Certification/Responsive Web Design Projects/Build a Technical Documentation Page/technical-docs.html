				<p>C++ is an object-oriented language, unlike C which is a procedural language. This is one of the most important features of C++. It employs the use of objects while programming. These objects help you implement real-time problems based on data abstraction, data encapsulation, data hiding, and polymorphism. We have briefly discussed all the 5 main concepts of object-oriented programming.</p>
				<p>The OOP concepts are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Data abstraction:</strong> Data abstraction is an act of representing the important features of data without including the background details or the method applied to obtain it.</li>
					<li><strong>Data encapsulation:</strong> Data encapsulation is nothing but a process to implement data abstraction by wrapping up the data and functions into an exclusive block.</li>
					<li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> The term inheritance refers to transferring the properties of the parent class to the child class. We can implement the basic idea of inheritance by creating more than one class, which we formally refer to as derived classes by linking them with what we call the base class. This concept reduces the redundancy of the program and makes it easy to transfer/copy the properties of one class to another.</li>
					<li><strong>Data hiding:</strong> Data hiding refers to protecting data from unauthorized access. It is basically responsible for securing the data. It is important to note that data encapsulation is different from data hiding as encapsulation mainly focuses on shifting the focus on important data than explaining its complex nature.</li>
					<li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> The word poly means ‘many’ and morphism means ‘forms’. Clearly, polymorphism refers to displaying that data in more than one form.</li>
				</ol>

				<header>Portable</header>
				<p>In simple terms, portability refers to using the same piece of code in varied environments.</p>
				<code>int main() { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!\n"; }</code>
				<p>Let us understand this C++ feature with the help of an example. Suppose you write a piece of code to find the name, age, and salary of an employee in Microsoft Windows and for some apparent reason you want to switch your operating system to LINUX. This code will work in a similar fashion as it did in Windows.</p>

				<header>Simple</header>
				<p>When we start off with a new language, we expect to understand in depth. The simple context of C++ gives an appeal to programmers, who are eager to learn a new programming language.</p>
				<code>[capture](parameters) -> return_type { function_body }</code><br>
				<code>[](int x, int y) { return x - y; } // inferred</code><br>
				<code>[](int x, int y) -> int { return x + y; } // explicit</code>
				<p>If you are already familiar with C, then you don’t need to worry about facing any trouble while working in C++. The syntax of C++ is almost similar to that of C. Afterall C++ is referred to as “C with classes”.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="High_level">
				<header>High level</header>
				<p>It is important to note that C++ is a high-level programming language, unlike C which is a mid-level programming language.</p>
				<code>try {</code><br>
				<code>&emsp;&emsp;std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec{3, 4, 3, 1};</code><br>
				<code>&emsp;&emsp;int i{vec.at(4)}; // Throws an exception, std::out_of_range (indexing for vec is from 0-3 not 1-4)</code><br>
				<code>}</code><br>
				<p>It makes it easier for the user to work in C++ as a high-level language as we can closely associate it with the human-comprehensible language, that is, English.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="Popular">
				<header>Popular</header>
				<p>After learning C, it is the base language for many other popular programming languages which supports the feature of object-oriented programming.</p>
				<p>Bjarne Stroustrup found Simula 67, the first object-oriented language ever, lacking simulations and decided to develop C++.</p>
